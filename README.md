# CeL-ID
CeL-ID is a new method developed for cell line authentication using variant profiles derived from RNA-seq data. Benchmarking studies on independent test sets have shown its robustness. CeL-ID successfully identifies identical, synonymous and derivative cell lines and also estimates about the possible contaminant. We have attempted to provide simple solution to problem associated with cell line authentication and hope this would help in adoption of regular cell line authentication.



Data Files:Due to size limitations we uploaded only truncated version (1K) of variants data file. Complete data is available on request from mohammadt@uthscsa.edu OR chenY8@uthscsa.edu. Nonetheless we uploaded complete COSMIC70 matched data files. 


Example_DP.txt - It shows depth of coverage (DP) values for first thousand variants derived from CCLE RNA-seq dataset.


Example_FREQ.txt - It shows frequency (FREQ) values for first thousand variants derived from CCLE RNA-seq dataset.


COSMIC70_matched files - Complete list of COSMIC 70 matched variants with DP and FREQ values, respectively (compressed format).
