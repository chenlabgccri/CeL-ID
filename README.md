# CeL-ID
CeL-ID is a new method developed for cell line authentication using variant profiles derived from RNA-seq data. Benchmarking studies on independent test sets have shown its robustness. CeL-ID successfully identifies identical, synonymous and derivative cell lines and also estimates about the possible contaminant. We have attempted to provide simple solution to problem associated with cell line authentication and hope this would help in adoption of regular cell line authentication.



Data Files: Due to size limitations we have only uploaded COSMIC70 matched data files here. Complete variants data files can be downloaded from following links:
